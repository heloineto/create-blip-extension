# Create Blip Extension

## Scaffolding Your Blip Extension

To start your extension, run the command below:

```shell
npm create blip-extension@latest
```

Then follow the prompts!

You can also directly specify the project name and the template you want to use via additional command line options. For example, to scaffold an extension using Typescript, run:

```shell
npm create blip-extension@latest blip-extension --template typescript
```

Currently, supported template presets include:

-   `javascript`
-   `typescript`

You can use `.` for the project name to scaffold in the current directory.

This project is inspired by Vite.js [Create Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite).
